# Pitch / Presentation
Pintrest for recipies

## Intro
### Problem
Cooking at home is becoming more popular than ever, but finding the right recipe remains a challenge. Most recipe sites are cluttered, outdated, and don't consider what users have in their kitchens. People waste time scrolling through long blog posts or hunting for alternatives when they're missing just a single ingredient. Social features like comments and ratings are often underdeveloped, and there's little community engagement or personalization.

### Audience
There's a growing culture on TikTok where people log and share what they consume - like books on Goodreads via BookTok or films on Letterboxd - yet there's no central platform doing this for food, despite its massive presence online. Our solution fills that gap: a social platform where people can track, review, and discover recipes or meals the same way they do books or movies. Our audience includes everyone from beginner home cooks to seasoned foodies, with a focus on food influencers and their followers who already drive viral food trends. Whether they're meal planning, reducing waste, or just looking for something new, users get a practical, social tool that fits naturally into how they already engage with food online.

### Solution
Our solution is Kitchen Fire - a social platform for food that functions like Goodreads or Letterboxd, but for cooking. Users can log, rate, and share recipes, while discovering new ones through an engaged community. Each recipe includes social features like ratings, views, and comments to surface quality content and spark discussion. Designed to align with the way people already engage with food on social media, Kitchen Fire creates a centralized space where cooking becomes more connected, trackable, and fun.

## How it works / Demo
### Using the site
When users use our site, they will first see the most trending recipes the home page. They will then have the option to add new recipes or explore our collection of recipes. The user will be provided a range of recipes which can be filtered by their tags and ingredient requirements. These recipies can then be saved to be viewed latter.

### Sharing from other sites (hopefuly this is a existing feature)
When users share recipes from other apps and sites they will have the option to share using our site. Our site will searched our database for this recipe, but if no match is found, a new recipe will be created containing the information from the original post. The user can then use this recipe or use this link to share this recipe.

## The rest of the pitch
### Why it's different
What sets Kitchen Fire apart is our focus on social logging and discovery, not just recipe storage or inspiration. Unlike Pinterest or generic cooking sites, we're building a community-first platform that taps into the emotional, trackable habits people already use for books and movies - applied to something even more universal: food. We deliver concise, easy-to-follow recipes with streamlined ingredient lists, so users can get cooking faster. Our platform prioritizes smart, ingredient-based discovery and meaningful interactions - likes, comments, and ratings - presented in a clean, intuitive interface. By merging utility with community, we surface high-quality content and create a social experience that feels both familiar and refreshingly focused.


### Future expansion
Easy way to add recipes from social media onto the site. (hopefully this is a existing feature)

This is just the beguining. We plan to integrate with supermarkets and social media: users will be able to generate shopping lists directly from recipe ingredients, and our content will be promoted across major platforms to drive engagement. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce smart features like ingredient photo recognition and pantry tracking - all aimed at creating a connected, intuitive cooking experience that reduces friction and food waste.
