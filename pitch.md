## Problem
Cooking from home has beceome more poplular than ever.
Recipes that go trending can be fond on sites all over the place and it can be hard to find the actual recipe.
Somethimes, these recipies can be annoying to read. On these sites, there is hardly any user interaction
Videos only talk about the recipe

## Solution
Photos -> Insta
Videos -> YouTube
Movies -> Letterboxd
Books -> Goodreads
Recipes -> US!

## Hit it works
When users use our site, they will first see trending recipes the home page. They will then have the option to add new recipes or explore our collection of recipes. The user will be provided a range of recipes which can be filtered by their tags and ingredient requirements. These recipies can then be saved to be viewed latter.

## The X factor!
Users may want to share recipes found on other sites, they will be ableo to share them using our site thorugh our recipe generator. All they need to do is provide the recipe url. This newly generated recipe will be added to our database for others to view in the future.

## Community based
Kitchen Fire stands out by focusing on social logging and discovery - not just recipe storage. Unlike other sites, this is a community-first platform inspired by how people track books and movies, applied to something even more universal: food. With concise recipes, smart ingredient-based discovery, and meaningful social features in a clean interface, we combine utility with community to surface quality content and create a familiar yet focused food experience.

## Money!
Initaly this would be a donation based site.
But latter, we plan to integrate with supermarkets, allowing users to generate shopping lists directly from recipe ingredients.

Additionally, we will be offering freemium options. This would range from premium recipes where you put a viral recpie behind a pay wall. Or, cooking seminars where we offer places for people to learn to cook for a price.

## Cost
To expland, there will be a cost.
This will invoulve, api for AI, database hosting and moderation.

## Future expansion
This is just the beginning.
Our content will be promoted across major social platforms to drive engagement.
We're also plan to develop smart features like ingredient photo recognition and pantry tracking - all aimed at creating a connected, intuitive cooking experience that reduces friction and food waste.
