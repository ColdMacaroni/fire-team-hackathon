<h2>Pitch</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
Cooking at home is becoming more popular than ever, but finding the right recipe remains a challenge. Most recipe sites are cluttered, outdated, and don't consider what users have in their kitchens. People waste time scrolling through long blog posts or hunting for alternatives when they’re missing a single ingredient. Social features like comments and ratings are often underdeveloped, and there's little community engagement or personalization.

<h3>Audience</h3>
Our primary audience includes home cooks of all skill levels — from beginners working with limited ingredients to seasoned cooks seeking inspiration and feedback. We especially target users who enjoy following food trends and discovering what’s popular, whether it’s a viral recipe or a seasonal favorite. This includes busy professionals, students, parents, and anyone looking to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, or try something new without the usual hassle.

<h3>Solution</h3>
Kitchen Fire is a food website that works like a social media platform — where users can discover, share and rate recipes. Each recipe features key metrics like ratings, views, and comments to surface quality content through community engagement. What sets us apart is our ingredient-based filtering: users can input ingredients they already have, and the site will only show recipes they can actually make. This makes cooking more accessible, spontaneous, and less wasteful.

<h3>Why it is different?</h3>
Unlike other recipe sites, we get straight to the point — no endless personal stories or mile-long ingredient lists. In a space lacking a true food-focused social platform, we aim to capture the market by combining the familiarity of social media with the utility users actually want. Our platform prioritizes user experience through smart, ingredient-first discovery and meaningful social features like likes, comments, and ratings — all without the recipe spam and keyword-stuffed content that clutters traditional sites. By merging utility with community, we deliver a clean, intuitive experience where quality content rises to the top.

<h3>Future expansion</h3>
We’re just getting started. Our roadmap includes integration with supermarkets and social media: users will be able to generate shopping lists directly from recipe ingredients, and our content will be promoted across major platforms to drive engagement. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce smart features like ingredient photo recognition and pantry tracking — all aimed at creating a connected, intuitive cooking experience that reduces friction and food waste.
