## Pitch
Pintrest for recipies

### Problem
Cooking at home is becoming more popular than ever, but finding the right recipe remains a challenge. Most recipe sites are cluttered, outdated, and don't consider what users have in their kitchens. People waste time scrolling through long blog posts or hunting for alternatives when they're missing just a single ingredient. Social features like comments and ratings are often underdeveloped, and there's little community engagement or personalization.

### Audience
our place on the market is:
on tiktok, 
booktok is a huge scene where people share and read books, and everyone uses goodreads to share
movies and tv discussion is one of the most popular video type, and everyone uses letterbox
i feel like we fit in this niche for foods to do the same thing as those other apps, and it feels very practical because everyone cooks. 
so we can make something trendy by connecting to this big community on social media.


Our primary audience includes home cooks of all skill levels - from beginners working with limited ingredients to seasoned cooks seeking inspiration and feedback. We especially target food infuencers and their followers, allowing followers to view viral recipes or seasonal favorites. This includes busy professionals, students, parents, and anyone looking to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, or try something new without the usual hassle.

### Solution
Kitchen Fire is a food website that works like a social media platform - where users can discover, share and rate recipes. Each recipe features key metrics like ratings, views, and comments to surface quality content through community engagement. What sets us apart is our ingredient-based filtering: users can input ingredients they already have, and the site will only show recipes they can actually make. This makes cooking more accessible, spontaneous, and less wasteful.

### How it works
#### Using the site
When users use our site, they will first see the most trending recipes the home page. They will then have the option to add new recipes or explore our collection of recipes. The user will be provided a range of recipes which can be filtered by their tags and ingredient requirements. These recipies can then be saved to be viewed latter.

#### Sharing from other sites (will this be a existing feature?)
When users share recipes from other apps they will have the option to share using our site. Our site will searched our database for this recipe, but if no match is found, a new recipe will be created containing the information from the original post. The user can then use this recipe or use this link to share this recipe.

### Why it's different
Unlike other recipe sites, we get straight to the point, we deliver concise, easy-to-follow recipes with streamlined ingredient lists, so users can get cooking faster. In a space lacking a truly food-focused social platform, we aim to capture the market by combining the familiarity of social media with features people actually use. Our platform emphasizes smart, ingredient-first discovery and meaningful interactions - including likes, comments, and ratings - all presented in a clean, user-friendly format that highlights quality content over clutter. By merging utility with community, we deliver a clean, intuitive experience where quality content rises to the top.

### Future expansion
Easy way to add recipes from social media onto the site. (will this be a existing feature?)

This is just the beguining. We plan to integrate with supermarkets and social media: users will be able to generate shopping lists directly from recipe ingredients, and our content will be promoted across major platforms to drive engagement. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce smart features like ingredient photo recognition and pantry tracking - all aimed at creating a connected, intuitive cooking experience that reduces friction and food waste.
